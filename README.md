# GoogleRedesign
My programming themed redesign of the Google front page. Created with HTML, CSS, JS, and the Bootstrap framework. I am currently hosting the site on one of my personal domains, http://codequick.org but if that link does not work you can also try http://aidenthetechboy.github.io/GoogleRedesign!
